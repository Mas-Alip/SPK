Purpose: Implement full AHP method (pairwise Saaty inputs, eigenvector, CR); integrate into Perhitungan UI and persist pairwise matrices.

Summary:
- Replaced manual AHP flow with full AHP capable of pairwise Saaty input.
- Added dialog for pairwise comparisons using Saaty scale; supports locking pair (Pendapatan vs Jaminan) with checkbox.
- Implemented `hitung_ahp_full` which computes local priorities per criterion (by building pairwise matrices of alternatives) and aggregates global scores.
- Added persistent storage of pairwise matrices (`kriteria_pairwise` table) and UI to view stored matrix.

Files changed / added:
- ui/perhitungan_ui.py — Added pairwise dialog, AHP Full computation, save/load pairwise matrix, show matrix UI.
- methods/ahp.py — existing utilities used (no change) for eigenvector, CI/CR.
- methods/saw.py — existing SAW utilities used.
- models/database.py — added `kriteria_pairwise` table creation.
- models/kriteria_model.py — added save/load functions for pairwise matrix.
- JOURNAL.md — added project journal template
- journal/2025-09-29.md — this entry

Testing / Validation:
- Ran syntax checks via `python -m py_compile` for modified modules.
- Performed import test for models and UI modules.
- Performed a DB save/load smoke test using a small script; matrix saved and loaded successfully.
- Manual GUI flow tested: pairwise dialog -> submit -> saved to DB -> show matrix -> show CR (uses saved matrix) -> hitung AHP Full.

Issues / Notes:
- Initial crash: `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: kriteria_pairwise` because DB wasn't initialized; fixed by creating table on-demand inside save/load functions.
- Pairwise matrix saved under a single 'default' key for now. Consider multiple named sets for scenarios.

Next steps:
- Add automatic call to `database.create_tables()` on application start to guarantee tables exist.
- Add ability to save multiple named pairwise sets and pick between them.
- Improve UI: show per-criterion CR, allow exporting pairwise to JSON/CSV.
